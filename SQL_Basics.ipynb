        "## Question 1: Create the employees table with constraints\n",
        "\n",
        "```sql\n",
        "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
        "    emp_id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,\n",
        "    emp_name TEXT NOT NULL,\n",
        "    age INTEGER CHECK (age >= 18),\n",
        "    email TEXT UNIQUE,\n",
        "    salary DECIMAL DEFAULT 30000\n",
        ");\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Explanation:**\n",
        "- `emp_id` is set as the primary key and cannot be NULL\n",
        "- `emp_name` cannot be NULL\n",
        "- `age` has a check constraint ensuring values are 18 or higher\n",
        "- `email` must be unique for each employee\n",
        "- `salary` has a default value of 30,000 if not specified\n",
        "\n",
        "## Question 2: Purpose of constraints and examples\n",
        "\n",
        "**Purpose of Constraints:**\n",
        "Constraints are rules enforced on data columns in a database table to maintain data integrity, accuracy, and reliability. They help:\n",
        "- Prevent invalid data from being entered\n",
        "- Enforce business rules at the database level\n",
        "- Maintain relationships between tables\n",
        "- Ensure data consistency across the database\n",
        "\n",
        "**Common Types of Constraints:**\n",
        "1. **NOT NULL**: Ensures a column cannot have NULL values\n",
        "   - Example: `emp_name TEXT NOT NULL`\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **UNIQUE**: Ensures all values in a column are different\n",
        "   - Example: `email TEXT UNIQUE`\n",
        "   \n",
        "3. **PRIMARY KEY**: Uniquely identifies each record in a table (combination of NOT NULL and UNIQUE)\n",
        "   - Example: `emp_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY`\n",
        "   \n",
        "4. **FOREIGN KEY**: Maintains referential integrity between tables\n",
        "   - Example: `dept_id INTEGER REFERENCES departments(dept_id)`\n",
        "   \n",
        "5. **CHECK**: Ensures values meet specific conditions\n",
        "   - Example: `age INTEGER CHECK (age >= 18)`\n",
        "   \n",
        "6. **DEFAULT**: Sets a default value when none is specified\n",
        "   - Example: `salary DECIMAL DEFAULT 30000`\n",
        "\n",
        "## Question 3: NOT NULL constraint and primary keys\n",
        "\n",
        "**NOT NULL Constraint:**\n",
        "The NOT NULL constraint is applied to a column to ensure that it always contains a value. Without this constraint, the column would accept NULL values, which represent missing or unknown data. This is important for:\n",
        "- Columns that are essential for record identification\n",
        "- Columns that participate in calculations or business logic\n",
        "- Columns that are referenced by other tables\n",
        "\n",
        "**Primary Keys and NULL Values:**\n",
        "A primary key cannot contain NULL values. This is because:\n",
        "1. The primary key's purpose is to uniquely identify each record in a table\n",
        "2. NULL represents the absence of a value, which cannot uniquely identify anything\n",
        "3. The PRIMARY KEY constraint automatically includes NOT NULL behavior\n",
        "4. Database standards (like SQL-92) explicitly require primary keys to be NOT NULL\n",
        "\n",
        "## Question 4: Adding and removing constraints\n",
        "\n",
        "**Adding Constraints to an Existing Table:**\n",

        "\n",
        "-- Adding a CHECK constraint\n",

        "ALTER TABLE products DROP CONSTRAINT unique_product_name;\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Steps Involved:**\n",
        "1. Identify the constraint name (for named constraints)\n",
        "2. Use ALTER TABLE command with appropriate syntax\n",
        "3. For NOT NULL, use ALTER COLUMN syntax\n",
        "4. For other constraints, use ADD/DROP CONSTRAINT syntax\n",
        "\n",
        "## Question 5: Consequences of constraint violations\n",
        "\n",
        "**Consequences:**\n",
        "When an operation violates a constraint:\n",
        "1. The entire operation is aborted (rolled back)\n",
        "2. No changes are made to the database\n",
        "3. An error message is returned to the application\n",
        "4. The transaction must be corrected and resubmitted\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example Error Messages:**\n",
        "1. **Primary Key Violation**:\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint \"employees_pkey\"\n",
        "   DETAIL: Key (emp_id)=(101) already exists.\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **NOT NULL Violation**:\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   ERROR: null value in column \"emp_name\" violates not-null constraint\n",
        "   DETAIL: Failing row contains (102, null, 25, jsmith@example.com, 35000).\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   \n",
        "3. **CHECK Constraint Violation**:\n",

        "## Question 6: Adding constraints to the products table\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how to add constraints to the existing products table:\n",
        "\n",
        "```sql\n",
        "-- Add PRIMARY KEY constraint\n",
        "ALTER TABLE products ALTER COLUMN product_id SET NOT NULL;\n",
        "ALTER TABLE products ADD PRIMARY KEY (product_id);\n",
        "\n",
        "-- Add NOT NULL constraint to product_name\n",
        "ALTER TABLE products ALTER COLUMN product_name SET NOT NULL;\n",
        "\n",
        "-- Add CHECK constraint for positive price\n",
        "ALTER TABLE products ADD CONSTRAINT positive_price CHECK (price > 0);\n",
        "\n",
        "-- Add DEFAULT constraint for price\n",
        "ALTER TABLE products ALTER COLUMN price SET DEFAULT 0;\n",
        "\n",
        "-- The table now has these constraints:\n",
        "-- product_id: PRIMARY KEY, NOT NULL\n",
        "-- product_name: NOT NULL\n",
        "-- price: DEFAULT 0, CHECK > 0\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Explanation:**\n",
        "1. First ensure the primary key column is NOT NULL\n",
        "2. Then add the PRIMARY KEY constraint\n",
        "3. Add NOT NULL to essential columns\n",
        "4. Add CHECK constraints for business rules\n",
        "5. Add DEFAULT values where appropriate\n",

        "Question 7: INNER JOIN Query\n",
        "\n",
        "The question asks to fetch `student_name` and `class_name` for each student by joining the `Students` and `Classes` tables using an INNER JOIN.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's the correct SQL query:\n",
        "\n",
        "```sql\n",

        "FROM Students s\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Tables Involved**:\n",
        "   - `Students` table contains student information with a `class_id` foreign key\n",
        "   - `Classes` table contains class information with `class_id` as primary key\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **JOIN Logic**:\n",
        "   - We match records where `Students.class_id` equals `Classes.class_id`\n",
        "   - This connects each student to their corresponding class\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **INNER JOIN Characteristics**:\n",
        "   - Only returns rows where there's a match in both tables\n",
        "   - Students without a valid class_id (or with class_id not in Classes table) won't appear\n",
        "   - Classes without any students also won't appear\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Column Selection**:\n",
        "   - We specifically select only `student_name` and `class_name` as requested\n",
        "   - Used table aliases (`s` for Students, `c` for Classes) for cleaner syntax\n",
        "Question 8: Multi-Table JOIN Query\n",
        "\n",
        "To solve this problem, we need to combine data from three tables (`Orders`, `Customers`, and `Products`) while ensuring all products are listed, even those without orders. This requires a combination of INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN operations.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **JOIN Strategy**:\n",
        "   - Start with `Products` as the base table (LEFT JOIN ensures all products appear)\n",
        "   - First LEFT JOIN connects products to their orders (if any exist)\n",
        "   - Second LEFT JOIN connects orders to customers (if any order exists)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Why LEFT JOIN for Products**:\n",
        "   - The requirement specifies all products must be listed\n",
        "   - `Phone` has NULL order_id, so it wouldn't appear with INNER JOIN\n",
        "   - LEFT JOIN preserves all products regardless of order association\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **NULL Values in Results**:\n",
        "   - Products without orders will show NULL for order_id and customer_name\n",
